This is a game that has 4 pictures with a randomly assigned number of 1-12.  There is also a computer guess between 19-120.  When you click the picture your score goes up.  If your score matches the computers guess then you win.  If you go over the score then you lose.

I also programmed the game to take you to a secret bonus game whenever you get 5 wins on the game.  The bonus game is a Role Playing Game.  You chose the hero you want to play as then you pick one of 3 opponents to fight.  Each time you attack your attack gets stronger and your opponents stay the same.  If you can beat all 3 opponents without losing all your health then you win!
